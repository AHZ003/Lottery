Create a program that will randomly provide seven lucky numbers, from 1 yo 49.
Ask the user how many draws to make.
Limit the draw to a maximum of 6 draws. If the user entered a draw number
>6, ask the user to resubmit a number, which must be <=6.
Use try and except loop to avoid user input error
Now it can throw a dice as well
